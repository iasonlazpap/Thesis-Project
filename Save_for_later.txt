We need to compute from the road agents, a graph for the moving of the people agents. The operator as_edge_graph allows doing that. It automatically builds from a set of agents or geometries a graph where the agents are the edges of the graph, a node represent the extremities of the agent geometry. The weight of each edge corresponds to the length of the road.

in init:
//shortest_path <- path_between (the_graph, living_place,working_place);
			
			//distance <- distance_between (the_graph, living_place, working_place);
			//distance <- distance_to (shortest_path);

int species people:

//if (flag = true) {distance <- distance + path_followed.shape.perimeter;}
		//flag <- false;

in species people: 

//path shortest_path;
	//bool flag;
